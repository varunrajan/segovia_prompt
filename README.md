# Segovia Deployment Manager Coding Exercise

We are excited that you are considering Segovia for your next role. As part of the interview process, we ask candidates to demonstrate their technical ability via a take-home exercise. Please take no more than 2 hours to finish this exercise.

Your task is to write a script that uses our public API to pay an amount to a recipient and then reports the status of that transaction immediately afterwards. For example, we'd like to send `1,200 Kenyan Shillings (KES)` to this phone number: `254999999999`.

Our public API is [here](https://docs.thesegovia.com/). You'll need a few pieces of basic information to get started:

- Public and private keys that you'll need are included in this package (and have already been registered on our servers)
- `key-id`: `er157YrM1WL`
- `client-id`: `homework-test`

We recommend looking at [Request Signatures](https://docs.thesegovia.com/signatures/) with some sample code to help you get started.

Please add suitable comments and explanation in your code as you see fit. If you don't finish or wish you could have done more at the end of the 2 hours, feel free to document what you would do next.

Happy coding!
